            Namaskar Parents, <br>
            <br>
            B's Learning Centre is a wholistic approach to introduce Hindi language to young kids. My name is Bhawna Chhatwal, and I am an experienced Hindi Teacher. I have over 10 years of experience teaching Hindi. I have taught students of various levels, including young kids, high school teenagers, and adults.
            I grew up in the vibrant city of New Delhi where I did my earlier education and graduated from Delhi University with a business major. Having lived in Delhi, Shanghai, Vietnam, Michigan and now Austin with my husband and daughter, I have realized the need to educate young kids with the amazing Hindi language.
            I started with a small batch with my daughter and few friends in Shanghai to introduce them to Hindi. Through my course work, I introduced Indian culture and mannerism to my daughter and her friends in a foreign land, and I am blessed to keep the tradition going in Michigan and Austin.
            My coursework is very adaptive and personalized. I prepare lessons keeping in mind each students’ needs and learning pace. In my classes, you will find-
            <br>

            <ul>
                <li>Simple and clear explanations</li>
                <li>Engaging and Interactive exercises</li>
                <li>Introduction to Indian culture and festivals</li>
                <li>Special focus on grammar and “Varnamala”</li>
                <li>Focus course work for high school kids testing out Hindi language for extra credits.</li>
            </ul>

            I am proud to say that I have got overwhelming love and affection from my student and parent community in USA and happy to say my kids are recieving high school credits as well.

                        My son had a wonderful experience learning Hindi under Ms Bhavana. She is very friendly and patient with the kids. 
                        As we do not speak Hindi at home, my son needed help to understand many of the new words that come up in the lessons. 
                        Ms Bhavana has been very patient and helped him understand the meaning of those words.
                        The classes started on time. The lessons were well structured and of the appropriate level. 
                        She also gave the kids some practice exercises for the week, which was very helpful. 
                        On many occasions Ms Bhavana spends extra time with the kids, in case they needed help on a specific topic. She is also very encouraging. 
                        Her classes were very engaging and my son would always learn something new after each class. We highly recommend Bhavana's Hindi classes.

                        Bhawna Chhatwal has been amazing with my kids. 
                        She is one of those teachers who can adapt her teachings based on the student’s ability. 
                        She will go that extra mile (and then one more) for her students.

                        My knowledge of Hindi was from studying a few years in school and then the famous Ramayan TV series. 
                        Over the years, I lost touch. Bhawna started with alphabets and systematically, now 15 classes later, 
                        I am becoming familiar with the language. Recently, I realized I am even able to pick up some simple dialogues from 
                        Hindi movies even without waiting for subtitles. I watch movies, try and increase my vocabulary (related to lessons learnt), 
                        trying to form common sentences that I may need.

                        Hope I am making reasonable progress.
